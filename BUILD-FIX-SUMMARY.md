# Build Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The build was failing with the error: `Error: supabaseKey is required` in the `/api/accept-quote` route.

## Root Cause
The application requires three Supabase environment variables that were not set:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` 
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## Problems Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing Environment Variables
- Created `.env.local` with placeholder values for all required Supabase environment variables
- Created `.env.local.example` as a template showing what variables are needed

### 2. Inconsistent Environment Variable Usage
- Fixed `app/api/boat-sales/route.ts` which was using `SUPABASE_URL` instead of `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- All other routes were correctly using `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`

### 3. Missing Dependencies
- Ran `pnpm install` to install all required packages

## Current Status
✅ **Build now completes successfully**

The build generated warnings about:
- Dynamic server usage in some routes (this is expected for API routes)
- Database connection errors (expected since placeholder values are used)

## Next Steps Required

### For Production Deployment
Replace the placeholder values in `.env.local` (or set them in your deployment environment) with actual Supabase credentials:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-actual-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-actual-service-role-key
```

### How to Get Supabase Credentials
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > API
3. Copy the Project URL for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
4. Copy the `anon` `public` key for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
5. Copy the `service_role` `secret` key for `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### Environment Variables Security
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are safe to expose in the browser
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` should be kept secret and only used on the server side

## Files Modified
- ✅ Created `.env.local` with placeholder values
- ✅ Created `.env.local.example` as template
- ✅ Fixed `app/api/boat-sales/route.ts` environment variable reference
